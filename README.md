Assessment Activity: Understanding the
Scrum Model of Agile and Git for Code
Collaboration
Problem-Based Activity on SOAP for a Medical Clinic System
Objective
The objective of this activity is to assess students' understanding of the Scrum model of
Agile methodology and their proficiency in using Git for code collaboration, specifically
within the context of a SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) system for a
medical clinic.

Activity Overview
Students will work in teams to develop a SOAP system for a medical clinic using Scrum
practices and Git for version control. The assessment will focus on their ability to apply
Scrum principles, manage tasks, collaborate using Git, and deliver a functional SOAP
system.
Description of the SOAP System
The SOAP system will be a web-based application that allows medical professionals to:
 Subjective: Record patient-reported symptoms and medical history.
 Objective: Document measurable data from physical exams and diagnostic tests.
 Assessment: Analyze the subjective and objective data to form a diagnosis.
 Plan: Outline the treatment plan, including medications, therapies, and follow-up
appointments.
Scrum Model Requirements
Teams must implement the following Scrum elements:
 Roles: Assign roles within the team: Scrum Master, Product Owner, and
Development Team members.

 Product Backlog: Create and prioritize a product backlog of user stories for the
SOAP system.
 Sprints: Plan and execute several sprints (minimum of two) to develop and deliver
increments of the SOAP system.
 Scrum Events: Conduct Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint
Retrospectives.
 Artifacts: Maintain a Sprint Backlog, Increment, and Definition of Done for each
sprint.
Git Collaboration Requirements
Teams must demonstrate eƯective use of Git for code collaboration by:
 Creating a remote repository for the project on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
 Using branches to manage feature development and bug fixes.
 Committing changes regularly with meaningful commit messages.
 Opening and merging pull requests for code review.
 Resolving merge conflicts collaboratively.
 Maintaining a clean and well-documented commit history.
Assessment Criteria
Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
 Scrum Implementation: Adherence to Scrum practices, eƯective role assignment,
and successful execution of Scrum events.
 Git Usage: Proper use of Git for version control, including branching, committing,
and merging practices.
 Collaboration and Communication: Team collaboration, communication during
stand-ups, and engagement in code reviews.
 Functionality and Quality: The functionality of the SOAP system, including the
accuracy and completeness of the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan
components.
 Project Documentation: Clarity and completeness of project documentation,
including user stories, sprint plans, and commit messages.

Deliverables
Teams must submit the following deliverables at the end of the assessment period:
 A functional SOAP system hosted on a web server or live demo link.
 The remote Git repository link with the complete commit history.
 Documentation including the product backlog, sprint plans, and retrospectives.
 A presentation summarizing their approach, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
Conclusion
This activity not only assesses students' technical skills in Scrum and Git but also
enhances their ability to work collaboratively on a real-world problem. By developing a
SOAP system for a medical clinic, students gain practical experience in applying Agile
methodologies and version control practices in a healthcare context.
